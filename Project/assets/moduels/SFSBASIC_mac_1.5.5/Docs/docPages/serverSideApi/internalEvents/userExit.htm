 <p class="itemName">Internal Event :: userExit</p>
 <p class="title">Availability:</p>
 <p class="plain">SmartFoxServer PRO 1.2.1 </p>
 <p class="title">Event name:</p>
 <p class="plain"><strong>userExit</strong></p>
 <p class="title">Description:</p>
<p class="plain">This event is fired each time a user leaves room within
  the current Zone.<br />
  The event is available for both <strong>Zone
  Level</strong> and <strong>Room
  Level</strong> extensions. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Zone Level </strong>extensions will receive the event when a user is
  leaving any room in that zone, while <strong>Room Level</strong> extensions
  will receive it only if the user is leaving that room. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> It is always reccomended to keep track of Users by
  using their unique id. For example you can keep a local list of users with
  their id as the key. <br />When
  a client leaves a room or is disconnected you will always receive the userId
  of the User that was lost, so it will be very easy to handle the event this
  way.

function handleInternalEvent(evtObj)
{
	if (evtObj.name == "userExit")
	{
		var uid = evtObj.userId
		
		// Get the user from the local list
		var user = myLocalUserList[uid]
		
		trace("User: " + u.getName() + "left the room")
