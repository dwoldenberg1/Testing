 <p class="subTitle">&raquo; Introduction</p>
 <p><a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank">JSON</a> is a lightweight data exchange format that has recently become popular thanks to technologies such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)" target="_blank">AJAX</a>. <br>
   It is particularly suited for serializing and deserializing ECMA-262/Javascript/Actionscript data structures in a compact, yet human-readable, form. <br>
   <br>
   <strong>SmartFoxServer 1.5.0</strong> introduces the ability to use JSON as a protocol for client/server communication: one of the main advantages of using JSON is the &quot;compactness&quot; of the format which usually allows a compression factor of 2 to 5 when compared to XML. <br>
   <br>
When compared to the raw, string-based protocol JSON is still slightly &quot;bloated&quot;  but it allows to transfer any type of data structure between client and server just like XML without the same overhead. <strong>Because of this we recommend to use JSON instead of XML in your extension communication</strong>. <br>
<br>
Refactoring old applications with the new protocol should take very little effort as you just need to change the <em><strong>type</strong></em> of protocol used in your server side calls and simply recompile your client application with the latest APIs. <br>
<br>For super-fast, realtime interaction it is still recommendable to use the string-based protocol.

 <p>You will find the main source file in the <strong>it/gotoandplay/smartfoxserver/smartmessenger/Messenger.as</strong> class (starting from the example folder) <br>
The server side extension is located in the <strong>sfsExtensions/messenger.a</strong>s file.</p>
