 <p class="plain">smartFox.onSpectatorSwitched(success, newId, roomObj) </p>
 <p class="title">Description:</p>
<p class="plain">The event is fired in response to a <strong>switchSpectator() </strong>request.
  The request to turn a spectator into a player may fail if another user did
  the same before your request and there was only one player slot available. <br />
  All spectators have their playerId property set to -1 when you become a player
  your playerId will get a number &gt; 0, representing the player number.<br />
  For example in a game room for 3 players your Id can be any number between
  1,2,3. These values are assigned by the server, based on the order in which
  the players joined. <br />
