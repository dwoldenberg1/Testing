 <p>A number representing the id of the client as a player. Available only after the client joined a game room.<br />
   Once a client joins a game room he's automatically assigned a player slot or id, based on the player slots available in the room at the moment in which the<br />
   user entered.<br />
   <br />
   <strong>Example #1: </strong>in a game room for 2 players the first user who
   joins becomes player 1 (playerId = 1) and the second user who joins becomes
   player two (player = 2)

   <strong>Example #2: </strong>in a game room for 4 player where only player 3 is missing the next client who will join will be player 3 (playerId = 3) <br />

   his playerId will be always set to -1<br />
