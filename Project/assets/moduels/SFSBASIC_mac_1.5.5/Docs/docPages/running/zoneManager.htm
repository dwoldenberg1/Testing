 <p class="title">3.4 Administrator Tool: Runtime zone management.</p>
 <p>From <strong>SmartFoxServer version 1.1.0 </strong> it is possible to manage
   your server zones dynamically while the server is running.<br>
   This feature is particularly useful when you need to update your zone settings,
   add new zones or disable one of them without the need to restart the server. <br>
   <br>
   Here's a list of what can be done:<br> 
   <br>
   &raquo; Activate or deactivate a zone on the fly. <br>
   &raquo; Add a new zone.<br>
   &raquo; Change the zone settings (uCount, buddyList, max users, max rooms
   etc...) <br>
   &raquo; Add, modify, delete moderators <br>
   <br>
   All these operations can be done without the need of restarting the server.</p>
 <p class="subTitle">&raquo; The Zone Manager:</p>
 <p><img src="images/admin_znManager.jpg" width="600" height="422"> </p>
 <p>By selecting one Zone node from the Zone tree you will be presented a screen
   showing all current settings for that zone. Also you will find three buttons:<br>
   <br>
   &raquo; <strong>Toggle Status: </strong>by clicking this button you can instantly
   activate / deactivate a Zone. By default all the zones loaded by SmartFoxServer
   are immediately activated in order to allow clients connections. By deactivating
   a zone you will automatically disconnect all currently connected clients and
   shut down the application. All attempts to connect to a disabled zone will
   be refused.</p>
 <p>&raquo; <strong>Refresh:</strong> request an update of the current view.</p>
 <p>&raquo; <strong>Send Message:</strong> sends an administrator message to
   all clients in the currently selected zone. It is reccomendable to send an
   alert to all users before deactivating a zone.</p>
 <p><span class="subTitle">&raquo; Reloading Zones and Settings: </span></p>
 <p>The <strong>RELOAD ZONES</strong> button below the zone tree will reload
   the entire &lt;Zone&gt; definition from the config.xml file.<br>
   <br>
 This process is made up of two phases:</p>
 <p>1) Create and activate the new zones found in the config file.<br>
   2) Apply the config changes to the currently running Zones.</p>
 <p>In the first phase the config file is analyzed and all new zones definition
   are activated, while in the second phase all changes done to the zone settings
   are applied and made available.<br>
   <br>
   This way you can add new applications on the fly, add and remove moderators,
   modify the capacity of each zone etc... </p>
 <p><span class="subTitle">&raquo; Removing zones?</span></p>
 <p>Now that you've seen how to add new zones and modify their current settings
   you may be wondering if there's a way to dynamically remove zones as well.<br>
   Actually this can be done in a couple of steps:<br>
   <br>
   1) Deactivate the zone: all clients will be disconnected and new connections
   attempts will fail.<br>
   2) Remove the zone definition from your config file and save it.<br>
   <br>
   Now the zone is hidden and ready to be destroyed.
   Next time you will restart the server it will be completely removed. </p>
