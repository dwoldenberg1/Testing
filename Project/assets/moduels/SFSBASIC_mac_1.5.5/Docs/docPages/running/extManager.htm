 <p class="title">3.5 Administrator Tool: Runtime extensions management.</p>
 <p>If you're using <strong>SmartFoxServer PRO </strong> you will be able to
   manage your server side extensions at runtime using the <strong>Administrator
   Tool</strong>. <br>
   <br>
   You will be able to:<br> 
   <br>
   &raquo; Remotely debug the extensions using the Trace window <br>
   &raquo; Enable / Disable extensions<br>
   &raquo; Reload server side extensions that have been modified<br>
   <br>
All these operations can be done without the need of restarting the server.</p>
 <p class="subTitle"><img src="images/admin_extManager.jpg" width="600" height="421"> </p>
 <p><span class="subTitle">&raquo; Changing the current View: </span></p>
 <p>Using the <strong>Zone Browser</strong> you will be able to switch from the <strong>Default
     View</strong> to
   the <strong>Extension View</strong> by clicking the combo-box at the top of
   the screen (see the orange arrow in the picture above).<br>
   The <strong>Extensions View</strong> will show you all the running extensions
   for the current selection in the tree on the left side. In other words, once
   you have selected a Room or a Zone you can switch view and check all the extensions
   that are running inside it.<br>
   <br>
   The <strong>Trace Window</strong> will show the trace messages coming from
   the extensions running in the selected area (Zone or Room). All messages are
   kept in a queue so you won't miss any of them, even if you're using another
   panel of the Admin Tool. The remote trace feature can also be globally disabled
   from the main configuration file. <br>
   <br>
   <span class="subTitle">&raquo; Disabling / Enabling extensions:</span></p>
 <p>At any time you can disable or enable an extension linked to a Zone or Room.
   When an extension is deactivated it will stop responding to any requests and
   it won't handle any internal server event. Also all it's threads (setIntervals)
   will be paused.<br>
   <br> 
   <span class="subTitle">&raquo; Reloading extensions: </span><br>
   <br>
   While developing your custom extensions you will be probably testing them
   many times. Because of this you may need to reload the extension in order
   to see the new changes in action. Just select the name of the extension to
   reload and hit the &quot;<strong>RELOAD</strong>&quot; button. <br>
   Extensions are always compiled before they are available in the server: if
   a compile error occurs, the extension will not be running and an error will
   be logged in the server console and file logs. Just check the error message,
   fix the problem, and finally reload it from the Admin Tool. </p>
 <p><span class="subTitle">&raquo; Loading new extensions at runtime:</span></p>
 <p>With <strong>SmartFoxServer PRO</strong> the Zone-Reload command will also
   load all new extensions found in the config file at runtime, without the need
   of restarting the server.</p>
