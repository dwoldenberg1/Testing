 <p class="title">3.2 Server Logs </p>
 <p><strong>SmartFoxServer</strong> can log a number of server messages based
   on their level of importance both to log files and to the console. 
   It also offers advanced options for splitting and rotating log files based on the type
   of installation you're using (standalone / service).<br />

	<p class="subTitle">&raquo; Basic logging (standalone mode)</p>
   
   <p>By default
   <strong>SmartFoxServer</strong> is configured to log messages of WARNING level
   to file and of INFO level to console.<br>
   The available
   levels from low to high are: FINEST, FINER, FINE, INFO, WARNING, SEVERE.<br>
   <br>
   The first four levels are related to simple notifications about actions taken
   by the server with different importance level: it can be useful to trace these
   messages to the console while debugging your multiplayer applications. This
   way you can see when a server-side variable is set or destroyed, when new
   rooms are created or removed etc...<br>
   This output can also be sent to the file logger but only for debugging, as
   this would make the log files grow too quickly.<br>
   <br>
   Generally speaking  it is recommendable to keep
   the file level to WARNING and the console level to INFO for production configurations.<br>
   <br>
   The <strong>WARNING</strong> messages informs about  some unexpected condition
   that has been found during runtime.<br>
   For example a malformed request could have been sent for different reasons:
   a hacking attempt or simply a programming error on the client side etc...<br>
   Other examples of WARNINGs can be a user trying to log in with the name of
   another existing user, a user trying to login when there's no more room for
   him etc...<br>
   <br>
   The <strong>SEVERE</strong> message level indicates that a serious problem
   is going on and it may cause the server to stop running. The conditions
   under which this error may appear are very rare. Most of these messages can
   occur when trying to start the server but some necessary files are missing
   or a configuration error is found.<br>
   <br>
   You can inspect log files by going in the <strong>log/</strong> folder
   inside the <strong>Server/</strong>   directory.
   <br>
   <br>
   A log rotation system is also provided to avoid unlimited growth of log files.
   You can specify the maximum size of a log file before a new one is created
   and the max. number of files that can be generated. By default the size is
   set to 500Kb and the max number of files to 5. (See <a href="../config/basics.htm">section
   2.1</a> for detailed info)<br>
   <br>
For specific documentation on how to configure the logging system please refer
   to <a href="../config/basics.htm">section 2.1 </a><br>

		&raquo; Advanced logging (service mode)
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have installed <strong>SmartFoxServer</strong> as a service (under Windows or Linux) all the console
		output will be redirected to the <em>wrapper</em> log files which also contain further log informations about the
		status of the <em>wrapper itself.</em> 
		The <em>wrapper</em> is the software that acts as a service/daemon and wraps the JVM process.
		(we usa a product called <a href="http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/" target="_blank">Java Service Wrapper</a>) 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		You can check and modify the wrapper logging options by opening the <strong>wrapper.conf</strong> found in the 
		<strong>Server/wrapper/ folder.</strong> By default the log files are stored in the <strong>Server/logs/</strong>
		folder and split every day.
