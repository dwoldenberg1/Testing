 <p class="title">3.1 The Basics </p>
 <p class="subTitle">&raquo; Running the server </p>
 <p>Running the server is a very simple task:</p>
 <p><strong>Windows:</strong> go in the Start Menu &gt;&gt; programs &gt;&gt; SmartFoxServer and
   click on &quot;Start&quot;</p>
 <p><strong>Unix/Linux/MacOS X:</strong> open a terminal window, locate the SmartFoxServer folder
   and just type ./start</p>
 <p>Once the server is running you can monitor it using the <a href="adminTool.htm">Administrator
 Tool</a>.</p>
 <p><span class="subTitle">&raquo; Flash player: connection restrictions and
     cross-domain policy file.</span></p>
 <p>Flash player version 6 introduced a number of restrictions when trying
   to connect or access resources  outside the domain where the SWF file
   is published. <br>
   In other words it was not possible to connect via XMLSocket to another domain
   or load assets/variables from a domain other than the one where the movie
   is located.<br>
   <br>
   For example if your SWF file was published on www.mywebsite.com it would have
   refused to load some variables from www.anotherwebsite.com<br>
   <br>
   With Flash player version 7 Macromedia added extra restrictions that don't
   allow connections even to subdomains of the parent domain.<br>
   <br>
   To overcome these limitations <strong>cross-domain policy files</strong> where
   introduced: these files are simple xml files that  should be published
   in the web root of the external domain you want to access. When you are pointing
   the flash player to a resource outside the current domain it will try to load
   the policy file from the web-root of the external domain and see if it can
   access the required resource. This is valid for XMLSocket connections, loading
   of variables, xml files and external movieclips. <br>
   <br>
Here's an example of a policy file:</p>
 <pre class="code">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM &quot;http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;cross-domain-policy&gt;
	&lt;allow-access-from domain=&quot;www.gotoandplay.it&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/cross-domain-policy&gt; </pre>
 <br>
 The first 2 lines declare the document type and the following 3 are those you
 have to edit. In this case we are allowing connections from www.gotoandplay.it
 domain but you could also allow all domains by substituting the 4th line with
 this one:<br>
 <br>
 <pre class="code"> &lt;allow-access-from domain=&quot;*&quot; /&gt;</pre>
 <br>
 This XML file should be always saved under the name of <strong>crossdomain.xml</strong> and
 it should be placed in your web root folder. In the case of www.gotoandplay.it
 the file should be reachable at this url: http://www.gotoandplay.it/crossdomain.xml<br>
 <p><span class="subTitle">&raquo; An easier way. (SmartFoxServer Basic and PRO
     only) </span></p>
 <p> In Flash Player 7 (7.0.19.0) and later, ActionScript can inform the
   Flash player of a non-default location for a policy file using <strong>System.security.loadPolicyFile</strong>. <br>
   <br>
   Let's say you have your SWF file published on <strong>www.mywebsite.com</strong> and SmartFoxServer
   running on another machine at the ip address <strong>192.168.0.1</strong><br>
   By using this line of Actionscript (before the smartfox.connect() method is
   invoked) you will be able to automatically authorize the flash player to connect
   outside the current domain:
<pre class="code">System.security.loadPolicyFile(&quot;xmlsocket://192.168.0.1:9339&quot;)</pre>
</p>
   <br>
   In other words you're requesting the XML cross-domain policy file from the
   server itself.<br>
   <strong>SmartFoxServer</strong> can automatically generate a valid xml cross-domain
   file and
   deliver it through the socket connection, simplyfing the solution to this
   problem. <br>
   By default this feature is activated. If you need more info please refer to
