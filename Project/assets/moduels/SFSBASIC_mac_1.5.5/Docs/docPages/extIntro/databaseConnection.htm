 <p class="title">6.3 Connecting to databases</p>
<p>By exploiting the JDBC and ODBC technologies, <strong>SmartFoxServer
     PRO</strong> is capable
   of connecting to almost any existing database engine. To name a few: MySQL,
   Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, IBM DB2 and a lot
   more.<br>
   <br>
   Accessing external data sources will enable developers to create complex multiplayer
   applications and games, adding data persistence 
   and allowing to access existing databases.<br>
   <br>
 <span class="subTitle">&raquo; The Database Manger </span> <br>
 <br>
 The <strong>SmartFoxServer</strong> extension API exposes an object called <strong>DatabaseManager</strong>,
 which is responsible for connecting to the external data source and interact
 with it. For each Zone in your <strong>SmartFoxServer</strong> configuration
 you can activate a separate
 <strong>DatabaseManager</strong>, allowing each application running in the server
to connect to a different data source. </p>
<p><span class="subTitle">&raquo; JDBC, ODBC and drivers.<br></span>
  <br> 
  In order to connect to your database engine you have two possibilities:<br>
  <br>
<strong>1)</strong> Use the Java Runtime built-in ODBC connector<br>
<strong>2) </strong>Download and install the specific JDBC driver for your database
engine.<br>
<br>
In the first case you don't need to do anything and you could skip to the next
section in this article. The ODBC connector is already provided in your Java
Runtime and you don't need to configure anything else.<br>
<br> 
Using a JDBC driver is also very common where the database engine does not support
ODBC natively (MySQL for example) or when the JDBC driver delivers better performance
than the ODBC one.<br>
In this case we reccomend to download the latest version of the driver and install
it, by copying it to your JRE <strong>lib/ext/</strong> directory, so that it
will be available to the Java runtime without having to mess with the
Java classpath.<br>
<br>
  <span class="subTitle">&raquo; Configuring database connections.</span><br>
  <br>
  Here follows the XML used in the config.xml file to set up a connection with
a MS Access database:
<pre class="code">
&lt;DatabaseManager active=&quot;true&quot;&gt;

	&lt;Driver&gt;sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver&lt;/Driver&gt;
	&lt;ConnectionString&gt;jdbc:odbc:sfsTest&lt;/ConnectionString&gt;
	&lt;UserName&gt;myUserName&lt;/UserName&gt;
	&lt;Password&gt;myPassword&lt;/Password&gt;

	&lt;TestSQL&gt;&lt;![CDATA[SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contacts]]&gt;&lt;/TestSQL&gt;
	
	&lt;MaxActive&gt;10&lt;/MaxActive&gt;
	&lt;MaxIdle&gt;10&lt;/MaxIdle&gt;
	  
	&lt;OnExhaustedPool&gt;fail&lt;/OnExhaustedPool&gt;
	&lt;BlockTime&gt;5000&lt;/BlockTime&gt;
	
&lt;/DatabaseManager&gt;
</pre>
<p>Even if it may look like a lot of paramaters, those that we need to specify
  are only a few.<br>
  The first thing to notice is the <strong>active</strong> attribute in the &lt;DatabaseManager&gt;
  tag which will turn on or off the connection to the data source. If you don't
  really need the Database Manager in your Zone you can completely omit it.<br>
  <br>
  The next four parameters are essential for a successfull connection:</p>
<table  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" nowrap="nowrap"><strong>Driver</strong></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>This is the name of the driver that <strong>SmartFoxServer
        PRO</strong> will use to connect
      to your database. In this case we use the default ODBC driver provided
      with the Java Runtime </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" nowrap="nowrap"><strong>ConnectionString</strong></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>This is the database connection string. The first part of it &quot;<strong>jdbc:odbc:</strong>&quot;
      should not be modified while the last &quot;<strong>sfsTest</strong>&quot; is the name of the Access
      database that we want to use </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" nowrap="nowrap"><strong>UserName</strong></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>This is the user name for the database </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" nowrap="nowrap"><strong>Password</strong></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>This is the password  for the database </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The last parameter we should specify is a test SQL statement that <strong>SmartFoxServer</strong>  will
  run after the connection is established to verify that the database is accessible.
  The &lt;TestSQL&gt;&lt;/TestSQL&gt; tag can contain any valid SQL statement.
  If the test string fails you will receive an error and you should check what's
  wrong with your settings. <br>
  <br>
  If we were going to connect to a MySQL database the configuration would have
  looked like this:</p>
<pre class="code">
&lt;DatabaseManager active=&quot;true&quot;&gt;

	&lt;Driver&gt;org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver&lt;/Driver&gt;
	&lt;ConnectionString&gt;jdbc:mysql://192.168.0.15:3306/sfsTest&lt;/ConnectionString&gt;
	&lt;UserName&gt;myUserName&lt;/UserName&gt;
	&lt;Password&gt;myPassword&lt;/Password&gt;

	&lt;TestSQL&gt;&lt;![CDATA[SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contacts]]&gt;&lt;/TestSQL&gt;
	
	&lt;MaxActive&gt;10&lt;/MaxActive&gt;
	&lt;MaxIdle&gt;10&lt;/MaxIdle&gt;
	  
	&lt;OnExhaustedPool&gt;fail&lt;/OnExhaustedPool&gt;
	&lt;BlockTime&gt;5000&lt;/BlockTime&gt;
</pre><br>
As you can see the only thinsg that change are the driver name and the connection
string. This time the &quot;<strong>jdbc:mysql&quot;</strong> tells the server
to use a MySQL driver for the connection, and the remaining part of the string
indicates the db server address, the db server port and the name of the database
we want to use.<br>
<br>
<span class="subTitle">&raquo; Advanced settings: connection pool<br></span>
<br> 
Each <strong>Database Manager</strong> is backed by a connection pool which allows
better performance and reuse of the server resources.<br>
We usually reccomend not to change the last four parameters in the configuration
block, however there may be cases in which you would need to adjust these values
based on the requirements of your application.<br>
<br>
( If you don't know what a Database connection-pool is, we reccomend to use the
default settings. ) <br>
<br>
The following table illustrates the meaning of the those tags:<br>
<br> 
<table  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" nowrap="nowrap"><strong>MaxActive</strong></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>The max. number of pooled connections </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" nowrap="nowrap"><strong>MaxIdle</strong></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>The max. number of idle pooled connections (-1 = no limits) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" nowrap="nowrap"><strong>OnExhaustedPool</strong></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Specifies what action should be taken when the pool of connections is
      exhausted:<br>
      <br>
      <strong>fail</strong> &gt;&gt; returns an error (RECCOMENDED)<br>
      <strong>grow</strong> &gt;&gt; grow the pool (Attention! You may need extra
      heap memory in your JVM or you could crash it)<br>
      <strong>block</strong> &gt;&gt; block for some time before returning an error</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" nowrap="nowrap"><strong>BlockTime</strong></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>used only if you choose to block when the pool is exhausted. Expressed
    in ms.</td>
  </tr>
