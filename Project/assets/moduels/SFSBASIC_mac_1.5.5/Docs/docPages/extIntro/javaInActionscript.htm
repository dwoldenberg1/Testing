 <p class="title">6.6 Introduction: Using Java in Actionscript</p>
 <p>The Server Side Framework is not only limited by the provided API, but it
   can easily access the entire <strong>Java2</strong> Framework and any <strong>other
   Java classes</strong>, providing
   an unlimited amount of possibilities for developers.<br>
   <br>
   Mixing Java classes in your Actionscript code is really very simple. Have
   a look at the example below:
<pre class="code">
   var list = new java.util.LinkedList()
   
   for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
   {
   		list.add("Item " + i)
   }
   
   // Use a Java iterator to cycle through the list
   for (var it = list.iterator(); it.hasNext();)
   {
   		trace(it.next())
   }
   </pre>
   <br>
   As you can see from the code, Java classes can be instantiated and accessed
   using their fully qualified name.<br>
   <br>
   With this approach there's really no limit to what could be achieved
   with <strong>SmartFoxServer PRO</strong>: parsing and writing XML, using XSLT and XPath, writing
   web services etc... <br>
   <br>
   Not only Java classes can extend the possibilities of what you can do on the
   server side, but they may also help in obtaining <strong>better
   performance</strong> in critical
   parts of your code. For example in a complex 2D array loop you may want to
   use Java native collections instead of Actionscript arrays to get faster code
   execution.<br>
   <br>
<span class="subTitle">&raquo; The Packages object </span><br>
     <br>
     A special object called <strong>Packages</strong>
is available to access Java classes outside of the J2SE standard packages.<br>
In order to access your custom classes you should add them to the classpath in
the start.bat (Win) or start.sh (Linux) scripts. <br>
<br>
Here follows an example that shows how to create an instance of the <strong>User</strong> class
inside the <strong>it.gotoandplay.smartfoxserver.data</strong> package<br>
<br>
<pre class="code">
	var data = Packages.it.gotoandplay.smartfoxserver.data
	var user = new data.User()
</pre>
<br>
A complete Extension example is provided with <strong>SmartFoxServer
PRO</strong> showing how
to integrate Java libraries in Actionscript, you can read it in <a href="../tutorials_pro/07_javaInActionscript/index.htm">chapter 8.7</a> <br>
