			After having one of his seven daily cigarettes on his best friend's Spanish style patio, Adam* '14, for the first time ever, licked approximately 75 micrograms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) off of a bland tasting square of blotting paper. Within 30 minutes Adam and his friends left to explore their familiar urban neighborhood. Knowing LSD posed no threat of addiction,  he relaxed and noticed the trees beginning to glow and the sun shining brighter than ever. Textures included cold smooth sidewalks and prickly grass; cotton-candy-like clouds began moving and morphing together in "slanky, lanky, curly shapes." <br>
 <br>
Unlike many other drugs, hallucinogens are not physically or psychologically addictive. Dr. David Kipper, a member of the California Society of Addiction Medicine and the American Society of Addiction Medicine, attributes this to the fact that they don't necessarily stimulate a high, which is why the brain does not crave them. <br>
<br>
Most substances Adam has used such as nicotine, adderral and alcohol are possibly addictive. When this concern is relevant, Adam tries to put a limit to his substance use if he notices a particular craving for it. With physical addiction concerns removed, students such as Adam may have worries that differ from addictive drugs. This can cause them to restrict their hallucinogen use differently from use of other substances. <br>
<br>
"My biggest fear with most drugs is them taking over me," Adam said.<br>
<br>
Adam recognizes that "there is a danger to every drug," but he feels that the benefits of hallucinogens outweigh the dangers.<br>
<br>
"LSD made me feel better than I ever had," Adam said.<br>
<br>
According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, Adam is just one of 779,000 Americans over the age of 12 who have used LSD within the past year.  <br>
<br>
"Hallucinogens are usually associated with people that are high risk takers," Kipper said. <br>
<br>
Hallucinogens are defined by their effect to distort the brain's reality, Kipper explained. The false perception of reality, according to Kipper, can cause the user to engage in dangerous behavior. He said the major long-term risk occurs when images from hallucinogen use remain and cause uncomfortable dreams and flashbacks.<br>
<br>
"The length of time these drugs stay in the body depends, but these memories can be seared into the brain forever, much like cattle branding," Kipper said.<br>
<br>
Hallucinogen users younger than 25 are at an increased risk for negative consequences for two reasons, Kipper explained. First, these individuals have not completely developed their prefrontal cortex, which Kipper describes as "a person's judgment center." Hallucinogen use at an adolescent stage can lead to an undeveloped ability to distinguish right from wrong. Second, the earlier an individual begins taking a drug the more likely they are to continue using it.<br>
<br>
Adam's recreational drug use started the summer after seventh grade when he began smoking pot. Since then he has used Xanax, marijuana, alcohol, LSD, Ambien and codeine. He said he enjoys hallucinogens the most.<br>
<br>
"The drugs we are most attracted to choose us," Adam said. "Hallucinogens have chosen me."<br>
<br>
Salvia divinorum (salvia) was the first hallucinogen Adam consumed. In the comfort of his cousin's house this past summer, he smoked salvia for the first time. He inhaled deeply twice, keeping each in his lungs for 20 seconds. Since then Adam has used salvia on one other occasion.<br>
<br>
"Salvia is one of the least worthwhile, least energizing drugs," Adam said.<br>
<br>
Despite his dissatisfaction with the drug, Adam took salvia to prepare for "the harder stuff" he intends to take in college, such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT).<br>
<br>
Adam was about 13 when he first became familiar with LSD. At about the same time, a close friend died. After first hearing about LSD he did not intend to take it, but his curiosity about the drug lingered. After two years without his close friend, Adam expected his grief would retreat, but it remained and became even more intense. He decided to take the hallucinogen to try to recall what his friend looked like. <br>  
<br>
"I just wanted to see her face before my eyes again," Adam said.<br>
<br>
Although the only visions of his friend Adam has seen have come from photographs, he believes LSD has restored much of his happiness. At this point, DMT is the only drug that Adam believes may have the potential of reuniting him and his friend.<br>
<br>
Unlike Adam's search for pain relief, Casper* '13 began his hallucinogen use for experimentation purposes.<br>
<br>
"I was really interested in them and the opportunity arose," Casper said. "It was circumstantial."<br>
<br>
For a total of $45 Casper and two friends purchased a three-foot long cactus that contained mescaline. The trio obtained the plant from an online seller and brewed it into a foul tasting tea. Casper said the trip lasted about seven hours although it did not feel this long.<br>
<br>
"It felt as if I was stuck in a singular static moment that was constantly getting smaller, as if time was infinitely shedding off in either direction," he said.<br>
<br>
Casper describes his one time mescaline experience as "intense," but he plans on using other hallucinogens in the future.<br>
<br>
"Hallucinogens aren't addictive so I feel inclined towards them," he said.<br>
<br>
There is no age restriction Casper is placing on his hallucinogen use. Nor does he see himself stopping usage if he were to have a "bad trip."<br>
<br>
"If I see the drugs getting ahead of my ambitions and aspirations in life I'd probably stop," he said.<br>
<br>
Casper believes getting to a point in which hallucinogens ruin his life is unlikely, despite his family's "daunting and scary" history of drug addiction. This hereditary characteristic provides "an element of fear" that forces Casper to be cautious of his drug use.<br>
<br>
Hallucinogens are currently "a casual timid interest" for Casper, but he imagines them becoming increasingly important in his future.<br>
<br>
Charlie* '13 also anticipates the importance of hallucinogens in years to come.<br>
<br>
"Psychedelics are intellectual tools," he said.<br>
<br>
Mescaline, LSD and mushrooms (psilocybin mushrooms) are the three hallucinogens Charlie has consumed. Authors such as Aldous Huxley, Terence McKenna, Timothy Leary, Hunter S. Thompson and Alexander Shulgin sparked his interest in the drugs. With each trip, Charlie tried to repress any expectations.<br>
<br>
"I feel like if you're expecting pretty visuals or some spiritual mystical experience you probably won't get that," he said.<br>
<br>
The visual element of hallucinogens had lesser value to Charlie than the intellectual experience, which is why he prefers the term "psychedelics" to "hallucinogens."<br>
<br>
"There is nothing magic in shrooms, or a cactus or a chemical. Everything's in you already; psychedelics are just a chance to pull back the curtain on that part of your mind," he said.<br>
<br>
Prior to his hallucinogen use, Charlie had trouble expressing himself to his friends and family. He claims it is a prevalent issue he is trying to improve. He believes that hallucinogens, particularly mescaline, have given him self-awareness, which helps to correct his flaw.<br>
<br>
"It's not to say the mescaline told me anything; it allowed me to internalize," Charlie said. <br>
<br>
With mushrooms, Charlie had the most "clear-headed" experience. It gave him a "modular" view of the world.<br>
<br>
"You're a non-player character in everybody else's RPG game," Charlie said.
<br>
Charlie does not place age restrictions on his hallucinogen use. Although he never intends to "trip just to trip."<br>
<br>
According to Charlie, it is impossible to have a truly bad trip because he believes all psychedelic experiences are learning opportunities. His positive experiences and lack of craving have caused Charlie to want to continue his hallucinogen use. He views alcohol as a more dangerous substance than any hallucinogen. Charlie is not fearful of his future with them partly because he researches each drug before consuming it. He also feels that his newfound self-awareness allows him to know his limits.<br>
<br>
"I can't think of a scenario where I would want to stop using them completely," Charlie said. 
<br><br>
Chaplain Father J. Young suspects that hallucinogen use is fairly low among students.
"I do not see hallucinogen use as often as I see marijuana or alcohol," Young said.<br>
<br>
 He is "happy to report this" due to his awareness of the connection between hallucinogen use and schizophrenia. Young said that if an individual is predisposed to schizophrenia and he or she uses hallucinogens they increase their risk of developing the mental disorder.<br>
<br>
While Young is unaware of a spike in hallucinogen use, some students have identified an increase in use.
"They aren't really party drugs, so I don't see them often, but I have heard more and more kids talking about them," said Lauren Lee '14.

			As she pulls up to a stoplight, Miley<sup>**</sup> '13 pulls a cigarette from her lips and puffs smoke rings out her car window. It's a skill she mastered after weeks of practicing.<br>
<br>
She smoked her first cigarette at a party out of curiosity, and hasn't looked back since. Her ex-boyfriend, a heavy smoker, only increased her nicotine usage.<br>
<br>
"He and I would spend a lot of time together," she said. "I adapted."<br>
<br>
Now, Miley smokes two to three times a day: once before school and once after, occasionally leaving campus to smoke during a free period if she craves a cigarette.<br>
<br>
According to a national study conducted by the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research in 2011, Miley is one of roughly 18.7 percent of high school seniors who smoke, 30 percent of whom will likely consume cigarettes into their adulthood.<br>
<br>
The U.S. Center for Disease Control reports that tobacco is responsible for approximately 443,000 deaths per year nationwide. Furthermore, developing adolescents younger than 21 years of age are more susceptible to addiction and have more difficulty quitting, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine website.<br>
<br>
Rock solid information like this doesn't deter students like Bernard** '13, who is confident that he is not and will not be addicted to cigarettes. He began smoking during 10th grade out of curiosity and "rebellious urges."<br>
<br>
"I probably smoke one every few days," he said. "Usually at home after finishing my homework, or if it's the weekend at a party. I just feel comfortable with it as a way to relax. I enjoy the way it makes me feel, but in small doses."<br>
<br>
Bernard acknowledges the respiratory and cardiovascular repercussions of smoking; however, he said he's not worried. One pack of cigarettes lasts him three weeks and he doesn't plan to continue past college. His father discovered his son's habit last year and was understanding.<br>
<br>
"He used to smoke, but doesn't anymore," Bernard said. "He knows I'm being cautious about it and, as someone who overcame smoking very easily, he knows that I can kick the habit whenever I want to."<br>
<br>
School psychologist Luba Bek identified the "rebellious urges" that Bernard spoke of as one of the main reasons adolescents take up smoking.<br>
<br>
"Adolescents are searching for an identity," she said. "Ironically right now, smoking cigarettes is a rebellious act not because it's not an okay thing to do, but because it's asserting ÔI'm different from everyone else.' In the previous decade, smoking was more about growing up. Now, it's more about standing out, although kids aren't willing to admit it."
<br><br>
Bek, who smoked as a teenager, said students need to be more serious about the negative effects of smoking.<br>
<br>
"You might think it's very innocent, but it's one of the most addictive substances," she said. "It's not considered to be as serious as heroin or coke, but it is a serious addiction that is life-threatening."<br>
<br>
Giselle** '13 said she won't smoke into her adulthood, and like Bernard, smokes for cigarettes' "relaxing effect." Her parents don't know that she smokes, and she plans to keep them in the dark. After taking a smoke, she chews gum and sprays herself with perfume to disguise the cigarette odor.<br>
<br>
Giselle sometimes feels the need to smoke during school, but claims that she isn't an addict. Although she goes through roughly a pack per week, she's not alone: she said she shares her smokes with friends, especially on the weekends.<br>
<br>
"School is stressful and can get annoying," she said. "Having a quick cigarette helps. I know it's bad for you, but I don't plan to do it forever."<br>
<br>
However, nicotine's relaxing effect is what ultimately gets smokers hooked, according to a 2010 article on the Livestrong Foundation's website. Nicotine activates feelings of pleasure and reward in the brain, and exposure to nicotine results in tolerance for the drug, which can lead to addiction because increasing amounts of nicotine are required to maintain its original effect. In fact, less than one in 10 people who try to quit smoking succeed.<br>
<br>
"The risk increases the longer you involve yourself with it," Cedars-Sinai Medical Group endocrinologist Dr. Eli Ginsburg  said. "It's the amount of smoking you've done over the number of years you've done it. None of it is exact."<br>
<br>
Ginsburg said in addition to commonly recognized ailments, like heart disease and lung cancer, cigarette smoking is associated with bladder cancer and chronic lung diseases like bronchitis. Furthermore, smoking only aggravates symptoms in people prone to asthma, even stimulating hidden heart problems to trigger defects like irregular heartbeats.<br>
<br>
According to statistics published in a BBC health news article Nov. 25, "Research has [also] repeatedly linked smoking and high blood pressure to a greater risk of cognitive decline and dementia."<br>
<br>
Samuel** '13 recognizes the danger smoking poses to his health and is trying to cut back on what he identifies as a frightening addiction. He started small, smoking twice a week at most. As he found himself swamped by the stress of junior year, he increasingly relied on cigarettes as a source of calm.<br>
<br>
"I started getting scared about my habit this summer," he said. "Once I recognized I had an issue, I tried to be more aware of how much I was smoking and began cutting down because I was doing it way too often. I was smoking one or two [cigarettes] on my way to school, one or two off campus during a free period and three at the end of school. It was bad."<br>
<br>
Now, Samuel limits his smoking during the day. When he goes off campus, he invites friends who don't smoke with him. That way, he's not tempted to pull out a cigarette.<br>
<br>
Some students, like Markley** '13, smoke to curb other negative desires.<br>

"When I stopped getting high, I needed a way to relieve stress," she said. "I met other sober people and they smoked to keep from falling back into old habits, so I joined."<br>
<br>
Markley said her stress level determines how often she smokes.<br>
<br>
"When I get stressed and find myself wishing I still had drugs, I'll go out and smoke a cigarette," she said. "Just one."<br>
<br>
Beverly Hills pediatrician Dr. Ronald Nagel said this is an example of "one [potential] addiction leading to another." <br>
<br>
"It is a much bigger problem in college," he said. "People smoke a few cigarettes and tell me, ÔDoc, I can stop any time I want.' We are creatures of habit. Once you get that taste in your mouth, you've opened up the door."<br>
<br>
Interestingly, Markley said she doesn't crave the nicotine. When her friends smoke, she feels no pressure to join them. Although she feels in control of her cigarette use, she has alternative methods of dealing with potential compulsion.<br>
<br>
"I have friends trying to quit who smoke electronic cigarettes, which are safer, to relieve stress," she said. "If it got to a point where I was smoking more, I would look into that."<br>
<br>
Nagel said e-cigs provide "the look without the danger," also citing nicotine patches as outlets through which potential addicts can ease off of cigarettes. However, he said, "you have to be motivated." He added that the few who quit successfully often experience weight problems later in life.<br>
<br>
"You're used to having something in your mouth," he said. "Eating is a form of addiction too. You're just changing one disease with another." <br>
<br>
His suggestion to avoid the potential ailments and addictions caused by smoking: don't do it in the first place.<br>
<br>
"Get high on sports," Nagel said. "Not drugs."
